### Notes

In order for a movie to be considered popular in my version of this app, it must have a rating of at least 8/10. I had trouble getting the rating bar to show the accurate number of stars (it was rounding), but I fixed the issue by setting the step size to 0.01. I also had an issue with the Glide transformation in the stretch story breaking the formatting of the list, but this was fixed by reducing the size of the placeholder image from Part 1 (the placeholder was previously larger than the image view size).

### Notes
I had to reinstall the app as I was making it when I got to the part where I first had to use AsyncHttpClient in order to avoid an error. It took me some time to figure out how to change the app icon and how to make the placeholder image readable to Android (converting SVG to XML). I changed the theme of the app from the default white with a purple header to a black theme.
The placeholder image was made by me. The app icon I used, ["Movie, music, player, video icon"](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/1564536/movie_music_player_video_icon) by [Artyom Khamitov](https://www.iconfinder.com/Kh.Artyom) is licensed under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). The app icon art is cropped from the original in different ways depending on if round or square icons are being used.
